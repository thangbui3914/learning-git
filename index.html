        <h2>My first Blog</h2>
        <p>
          To anyone reading this, thank you for reading this half-baked
          incompentent mess. I'm trying to improve my web dev skill by making a
          blog, but with little to no programming skill and English not being my
          native language. It's probably won't be good :) ...Even so, I'll try
          my best, with enthusiasm, hope and most immportantly kick-ass music in
          the background, heh heh. Hope you have a nice day.
        </p>

        <h2>Today is a hard day</h2>
        <p>
          Today, I don't even have anytime to self-learn web dev. I woke at 5am
          wondering "did I even fell a slep", because I remembered being fully
          awake during my sleep. Due to that, the day start off terrible as I
          don't have any energy to either learn or study. At night, I decided to
          move my sleep location from upstair to my bedroom (I had to move
          upstair due to COVID isolation, I didn't matter anyway since my whole
          family tested positive :v ). That mean, moving my mattress, book,
          notebook, laptop, bug net... from upstair down. When I finished
          moving, My whole body was sweating like crazy and I relized, I haven't
          finished my japanese homework and math homework. so yeah..., at the
          end of the day, I was tired and don't have any stregth left to self
          learn web dev, but I wrote this instead :D.... Anyway, thanks for
          reading my missery. I promise to continue learning web dev tomorrow.
